Hey indie gaming community!

It's searching for a tiny grey dot after you've conquered 81/82 territories.

Development:
• Solo dev (me!)
• 2 weeks
• Python + Pygame
• $0 budget
• 2,200 lines of love

Features:
• 5 AI factions (actually smart)
• 82 territories
• 3-resource economy  
• Save/load system
• Hot-seat multiplayer
• "The Grey Dot Moment™"

Philosophy:
"Metti un colpo di scena quando tutto sembra vinto"

Result:
A game where anticlimactic becomes climactic.

Try it yourself. When you've fought 81 epic battles, your brain is in "war mode".

Switching to "pixel hunt mode" is... difficult 😂

The grey dot doesn't care about your military supremacy.
