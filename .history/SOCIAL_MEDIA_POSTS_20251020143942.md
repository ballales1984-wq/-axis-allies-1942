## 🎮 **REDDIT - r/gaming**

### **POST #1: LAUNCH**

**Title:**  
*I made a strategy game where the hardest part isn't winning battles... it's finding the last grey dot*

**Body:**
```
So I just released GreatWar3, and playtesters are telling me the most memorable moment isn't the epic battles or the strategic comebacks.

It's the 5 minutes they spend hunting for ONE neutral territory when they control 81/82.

Here's what happens:

TURN 1-10: You're dying. AI has 2x your resources. Survival mode.
TURN 15-20: Epic back-and-forth battles. You're growing stronger.
TURN 25: You have $30,000, 10 bombers, unstoppable army.
TURN 26: ...where the f*** is the last territory?

You've eliminated all enemies. Map is 99% yours. But that 1 grey dot?  
Hidden somewhere on a world map with 82 territories.

From god of war → pixel hunter in seconds.

And when you FINALLY find it? *chef's kiss*

Features:
• 5 AI factions (actually challenging)
• 82 territories on world map
• 3-resource economy (Money, Oil, Tech)
• Progressive difficulty curve
• The Grey Dot Moment™

Free & open source. Made with Python + Pygame.

Would love to hear your thoughts! Have you ever had a similar "anticlimax that's actually the climax" moment in a game?

### **POST #2: GAME DESIGN PHILOSOPHY (r/gamedev)**

**Title:**  
*The "Grey Dot Moment" - When Emergent Gameplay Creates Better Stories Than Scripted Events*

**Body:**
```
I want to share a game design lesson I learned the hard way.

Background: I'm making GreatWar3, a strategy game where you conquer the world. Standard stuff.

The Planned Experience:
- Intense battles ✓
- Economic growth ✓
- Tech progression ✓
- Epic finale ✓

The ACTUAL Experience Players Had:
- Intense battles ✓
- Economic growth ✓
- Tech progression ✓
- Epic finale... and then 5 minutes searching for a grey dot ✓✓✓

What Happened:
When players conquered 81/82 territories and eliminated all enemies, they still needed to find 1 neutral territory to win.

No more battles. No more strategy.
Just: "Where the hell is that grey dot on this map?"

And players LOVED it.

Why It Works:
1. Emotional Variety - From power fantasy to humble search
2. Subverted Expectations - Anticlimax becomes climax
3. Relatable Frustration - We've all lost our keys
4. Satisfying Resolution - Finding it feels EARNED
5. Story to Tell - "I conquered 81 territories but..."

The Lesson:
Sometimes the best design emerges from your systems, not your plans.

Don't patch out "The Grey Dot Moment."
Embrace it.

Thoughts? Have you had similar emergent moments in your games?

### **THREAD #2: BEHIND THE SCENES**

```
🎨 How I made GreatWar3 in [X weeks]

A thread about:
• Game design philosophy
• Python + Pygame magic  
• The accidental genius moment
• Why simple can be epic

Let's go 🧵👇

1/12

---

The Vision:
"Risk + Civilization + That Feeling™"

That feeling when:
✓ You're losing but comeback
✓ Economy explodes  
✓ You unlock new tech
✓ One move changes everything

Wanted to bottle that. 🍾

2/12

---

Tech Stack:
• Python 3.7+ (because it's beautiful)
• Pygame (old school, still works)
• 2,200 lines of code
• 0 external dependencies
• Works on potato PCs ✓

Simplicity = Accessibility

3/12

---

The AI:
Not fancy ML.
Just smart rules:

• Buy in 7 territories (not 3)
• Attack 3x per turn (not 1)
• 65% aggression (not 30%)
• +500$ bonus each turn
• Targets weakest enemies first

Result: Actually challenging 💪

4/12

---

The Economy:
3 resources (not 1):

💰 Money - Buy units
⛽ Oil - Fuel attacks  
🔬 Tech - Auto-upgrade

Conquer territory = Get ALL their resources

Creates the "snowball effect" ❄️

5/12

---

The Map:
82 territories
Real world locations
Each has:
• Income
• Oil production
• Tech points
• Strategic value

Placed by hand (yes, all 82) 🗺️

6/12

---

The Combat:
Not random.
Not predetermined.

Dice-based with:
• Unit types matter
• Tech bonuses matter
• Quantity matters
• Distance matters

Skill + Luck balance ⚖️

7/12

---

The Growth Curve:
Turn 1: $5,000
Turn 10: $8,000
Turn 20: $15,000
Turn 25: $30,000+

Territories develop over time
Resources compound
Power fantasy EARNED 📈

8/12

The Accidental Genius:
"The Grey Dot Moment"

I didn't plan it.
Playtesters discovered it.
Now it defines the game.

Best design is emergent design 💡

## 📧 **EMAIL TEMPLATES - INFLUENCER OUTREACH**

### **EMAIL #1: MICRO-INFLUENCER (10K-50K)**

**Subject:** Free indie strategy game with unexpected twist (+ unique moment)

```
Hi [Name],

Quick intro: I'm Alessio, solo indie dev from Italy.

I made GreatWar3 - strategy game where the most memorable moment isn't winning... it's searching for a grey dot.

The Unique Hook:
Players conquer 81/82 territories, eliminate all enemies, become unstoppable... then spend 5 minutes looking for ONE neutral territory on the map.

From god of war → pixel hunter. Instant meme material.

Why Your Audience Would Love It:
• Challenging AI (starts with 2x player resources)
• Emotional rollercoaster (desperation → domination → confusion)
• Shareable moments ("Where's YOUR grey dot?")
• Completely free

No sponsorship needed. Just think it's perfect for your content style.

Interested in trying it?

GitHub: https://github.com/ballales1984-wq/greatwar3

Best,
Alessio

P.S. - If you find the grey dot in under 2 minutes, I'll be impressed.

### **EMAIL #2: GAMING PRESS (PC Gamer, RPS, etc.)**

**Subject:** [PITCH] Strategy game where anticlimactic finale is the climax

```
Hi [Editor Name],

Pitch: "The Grey Dot Moment - How an indie dev accidentally created 2025's most memorable game design moment"

The Story:
GreatWar3 is a Python strategy game with a twist nobody planned.

When players conquer 81/82 territories, all enemies are dead. They're invincible. Victory is one territory away.

But that last territory? It's a tiny neutral grey dot somewhere on a world map.

Players spend 5+ minutes searching for it. From world conqueror to pixel hunter.

It's anticlimactic. It's frustrating. It's PERFECT.

And it wasn't designed - it emerged.

Why This Matters:
• Shows power of emergent gameplay
• Proves simple mechanics → complex emotions
• Perfect example of "less is more"
• Made by solo dev in 2 weeks
• Completely free/open source

Angle Ideas:
1. "The accidental game design genius of The Grey Dot"
2. "Why searching for pixels is more fun than epic battles"
3. "The $0 indie game teaching AAA studios about emotion"

Assets Available:
• Gameplay footage
• Developer interview
• Player testimonials
• Source code access

Interested in covering?

Best,
Alessio Ballini
Developer, GreatWar3

Thanks! The moment you find that last grey dot after 5 minutes of searching... 
*chef's kiss* 

Let me know how long it takes you! Most players: 3-7 minutes 😅
```

### **Response #2: "Is it really that hard?"**
```
The battles? Challenging but fair.
The strategy? Deep but accessible.
The grey dot? A pixel on a world map when you've been staring at epic battles for 25 turns.

Your brain literally can't switch modes fast enough 😂
```

### **Response #3: "What inspired this?"**
```
Honestly? The "grey dot moment" wasn't planned.

I was testing the game, conquered everything, and thought "wait, where's the last one?"

Spent 5 minutes looking. When I found it, I realized: THIS is the moment.

Best game design is often accidental ✨
